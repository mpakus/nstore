# NStore

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mpakus/nstore.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mpakus/nstore)

Store gives you a thin wrapper around serialize for the purpose of storing hashes in a single column. It's like a simple key/value store baked into your record when you don't care about being able to query that store outside the context of a single record.

You can then declare accessors to this store that are then accessible just like any other attribute of the model. This is very helpful for easily exposing store keys to a form or elsewhere that's already built around just accessing attributes on the model.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nstore'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nstore

## Usage

First include NStore module to your class/model and then describe hash-map attribute, list of accessors and couple of options.

```ruby
  class User
    include NStore
    
    attr_accessor :meta
    
    nstore :meta, 
           accessors: {
             profile: {
                 :uid, :url, :avatar,
                 contact: [:email, :telegram, :twitter, :github] 
             },
             account: [:number]        
           },
           prefix: false,
           stringify: false
    ...                
  end
```  

This will generate several setter and getter methods:

```ruby
user = User.new
user.profile_uid = 100
user.profile_url
user.profile_avatar
user.profile_contact_email = 'renat@aomega.co'
user.profile_contact_telegram
user.profile_contact_twitter
user.profile_contact_github
user.account_number = 300

puts user.account_number
=> 300
```

List of options:

- `prefix` - (false by default) allows you to generate methods with the prefix of the original attribute or without
  
  if in the example above, replace `prefix` with `true` value then nstore generates methods:
  `user.meta_profile_uid` ... `user.meta_account_number`
  
- `stringify` - (true by default) this option is useful for serialization of a hash-map attribute into JSON/YAML format or for saving it in 
  a Database HSTORE/JSON/JSONB if you use symbol keys as accessors
  
Possible to use with ActiveRecord model.

```ruby
class Dump < ActiveRecord::Base
  include NStore

  store :meta, serialize: JSON # use store_accessor with PostgreSQL and HSTORE/JSON/JSONB type
  store :storage, serialize: JSON

  nstore :meta,
         accessors: { board: %i[id name] },
         prefix: false
  nstore :storage,
         accessors: { board: %i[id name] },
         prefix: true
  ...
```

creates list of methods to get and set nested values:
```ruby
dump = Dump.new
dump.board_id = 100
dump.board_name = 'Meta'
dump.storage_board_id = 300
dump.storage_board_name = 'Storage Board'
dump.save!

puts dump.board_id
=> 100
puts dump.board_name
=> "Mega"
puts dump.storage_board_id
=> 300
puts dump.storage_board_name
=> "Storage Board"
```

When using couple of `nstore` declarations in the same Class, please, use `prefix: true` to avoid conflicts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
